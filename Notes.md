## Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for Neuronal Networks and Expanding Connectomes

Initial set of experiments [here](https://github.com/devoworm/Theoretical-Types-of-Embryo-Developmental-Networks/tree/master/Network-Connectivity-TSP-Experiments).

* design a series of experiments to make model less generic.

* define initial conditions of information flows (all connections in network, or certain subset of connections).

* circuit model vs. or complementary to axon guidance and Hebbian learning.

* papers on using neural networks to solve TSP, but not within recurrent connectomes. Neural networks >> TSP >> solve problem in environment, not expanding neuronal network >> TSP >> organization in the brain.
